The motivation for creating this app is  to assist developers write README.md files. Having a README generator, as opposed to creating the file completely fom scratch, makes it easier and faster to create a README.  When a developer opens the terminal and  runs the file in node, they are presented with prompts, such as title, description, installation, ect., to create a README.md. After answering all of the prompts, a README.md file generated.
